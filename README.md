# Resort-Template
 A simple resort template website

This is a free-to-use template, the code is simple and does not contain any webpack builds, no complex CSS as such this uses a CSS framework called Bulma CSS version 0.7.2(outadated). Ultimately, this is very easy for a beginner to look at and learn. The Javascript used for this is jQuery 3.3.1 and Owl Carousel 2.3.4. You can find these all at dependencies folder. 

The website was built around 2019 during my highschool days(currently a college student right now). 

I am also available for freelancing, currently a Full Stack Developer with a focus on MongoDB, ExpressJS, VueJS, and NodeJS(MEVN) stack. I also know how to use Socket.IO and build mobile apps through Ionic-Vue.
